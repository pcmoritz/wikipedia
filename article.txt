The film, which [[Films with live action and animation|combines live-action with animation]], stars [[Philip Michael Thomas|Philip Thomas]], [[Charles Gordone]], [[Barry White]], and [[Scatman Crothers]], all of whom appear in both live-action and animated sequences. ''Coonskin'' makes reference to various elements from [[African-American culture]], ranging from African folk tales to the work of cartoonist [[George Herriman]], and [[satire|satirizes]] [[racism|racist]] and other [[stereotype]]s, as well as the [[blaxploitation]] genre, ''[[Song of the South]]'', and ''[[The Godfather]]''. Originally produced under the titles ''Harlem Nights'' and ''Coonskin No More...'', ''Coonskin'' encountered controversy before its original theatrical release when the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] criticized the content as being racist. When the film was released, [[Bryanston Distributing Company|Bryanston]] gave it limited distribution and it initially received negative reviews. Later re-released under the titles ''Bustin' Out'' and ''Street Fight'', ''Coonskin'' has since been reappraised. A ''New York Times'' review said, "[''Coonskin''] could be [Ralph Bakshi's] masterpiece."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> Bakshi has stated that he considers ''Coonskin'' to be his best film.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/> ==Plot== In the South, Sampson and the local Preacherman plan to bust out their friend Randy from prison. As they rush to the prison, the two are stopped by a roadblock and have a shootout with the police. Meanwhile, Randy and another cellmate named Pappy escape from inside the prison and wait for Sampson and the Preacherman to help them get out. While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens to Pappy tell a story about three guys that resemble Randy and his friends. Pappy's story is told in [[animation]] set against live-action background photos and footage. [[Br'er Rabbit|Brother Rabbit]], [[Br'er Bear|Brother Bear]], and [[Br'er Fox|Preacher Fox]] are forced to pack up and leave their Southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a [[brothel]]. The trio moves to [[Harlem]], "home to every black man". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be. They encounter a [[confidence trick|con man]] named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of "[[race and appearance of Jesus|Black Jesus]]", and that he gives his followers "the strength to kill [[Caucasian race|white]]s". In a flashy stage performance in his "church", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression—represented by images of [[John Wayne]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[Richard Nixon]], before asking his parishioners for "donations". When Rabbit attempts to turn the crowd, Savior tries to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit that if he can't kill his opponents, then they'll kill him instead. Rabbit first goes up against Madigan, a virulently racist and [[homophobia|homophobic]] white police officer and [[bagman]] for the [[Mafia]], who demonstrates his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes they're not worth it). When Madigan finds out that Rabbit has been taking his payoffs, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called "The Cottontail". A black [[stripper]] distracts him while an [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] sugar cube is dropped into his drink. Madigan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate [[gay]] man, and then shoved into women's clothing representative of the [[mammy archetype]], adorned in [[blackface]], and shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. While recovering from being drugged, he fires his gun randomly, and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them.<ref name="James">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-312-13192-5 |chapter=Rappin' with the rib-ticklin' Ralph Bakshi |pages=117–123 }}</ref> Rabbit's final target is the [[Capo di tutti capi|Godfather]] who lives in the subway with his wife and gay sons. The [[Contract killing|contract]] for killing Rabbit is given to his only [[Heterosexual|straight]] son Sonny. Arriving outside Rabbit's nightclub in blackface and clothing representative of [[minstrel show]] stereotypes, Sonny is shot multiple times by Rabbit before dying in an explosion caused by a car crash. His body is cremated and taken back home, where his mother weeps over his ashes. Bear becomes torn between staying with Rabbit or starting a new crime-free life. Bear decides to look for Fox in order to seek his advice. Upon arriving at Fox's newly acquired brothel, Bear is "married" to a girl he, Fox, and Rabbit met during the fight with Savior's men. Under the advisement of Fox, Bear becomes a boxer for the Mafia. During one of Bear's fights, Rabbit sets up a melting imitation of himself made out of [[tar]]. As the [[Mafioso (criminal)|Mafioso]]s take turns stabbing at the "[[tar baby|tar rabbit]]", they become stuck together. Rabbit, Bear, Fox, and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up. The live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping from the prison while being shot at by various white cops, but managing to make it out alive. The main plot of the film is interspersed with animated [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] depicting a white, blond, large-breasted [[Miss America]] who serves as a personification of the [[United States]]. In each of these short scenes, she seduces an African-American man and then kills him. ==Cast== * [[Philip Michael Thomas]] – Randy * [[Barry White]] – Sampson * [[Charles Gordone]] – Preacherman * [[Scatman Crothers]] – Pappy ===Voices=== * [[Philip Michael Thomas]] - Brother Rabbit * [[Barry White]] - Brother Bear * [[Charles Gordone]] - Preacher Fox * [[Scatman Crothers]] - Old Man Bone, Additional Voices * Danny Rees – Clown * Buddy Douglas – Referee * Jim Moore – Mime * [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] – The Godfather * [[Richard Paul (actor)|Richard Paul]] – Sonny * [[Frank de Kova]] – Madigan * [[Ralph Bakshi]] – Cop With Megaphone ==Production history== Not long after Ralph was born in [[Haifa]], Palestine, the Bakshis moved to a mostly African-American and Jewish neighborhood in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section of [[Brooklyn]], New York. Around April 1947, Ralph's father and uncle then traveled to Washington D.C. in search of new business opportunities, moving the family into a building in the entirely black neighborhood of [[Foggy Bottom]].<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106">{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=106; 108–109; 114; 127 |chapter=Coonskin }}</ref> Ralph recalls that "All my friends were black, everyone we did business with was black, the school across the street was black. It was segregated, so everything was black. I went to see black movies; black girls sat on my lap. I went to black parties. I was another black kid on the block. No problem!"<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/> Because Bakshi felt that it was not fair for him to walk several miles every day to attend Greenleaf Elementary School while his friends attended segregated schools, he asked his mother if he could attend school with his friends, and she agreed. Bakshi was the only white student in the classroom.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/> Most of the students had no problem with Bakshi attending the school, but the teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Suspecting that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from the classroom.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/> Meanwhile, Ralph's father had been experiencing anxiety attacks and stress. Within a few months, Ralph's mother sold their store, and the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/> These experiences had a strong impact on Bakshi, and led him to develop ''Harlem Nights'', a satirical film loosely based upon the ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' storybooks.<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/> During the production of ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'', filmmaker Ralph Bakshi met and developed an instant friendship with producer [[Albert S.

Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury)'', [[Darius James]] writes that "Bakshi pukes the iconographic bile of a racist culture back in its stupid, bloated face, wipes his chin and smiles ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' style. [...] He subverts the context of Hollywood's entire catalogue of racist black iconography through a series of swift cross-edits of original and appropriated footage."<ref name="James"/> The film also features equally exaggerated portrayals of white [[Southern United States|Southerner]]s, Italians, and homosexuals, also presented in a satirical context.<ref name="James"/> The depiction of Jewish characters stems from stereotypes portrayed in [[Nazi]] propaganda, including ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|The Eternal Jew]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tarantino |first1=Quentin |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |page=11 |chapter=Foreword }}</ref> According to Bakshi, although producer Albert S. Ruddy was "fine" with the satire, it seemed that no one really knew what Bakshi was up to as he worked on the film. "Everyone thought the picture was going to be anti-black. I intended it to be anti-idiot."<ref name="Metro-2">{{cite news |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.27.03/dolemite-0309.html |title=''Monstrosious!

Nor is it anti-Jewish, anti-Italian, or anti-American, all of whom fall prey to Bakshi's wicked caricaturist's pen as intensely as any of the blacks in his movie. What Bakshi is against, as this film makes abundantly clear, is the cheats, the rip-off artists, the hypocrites, the phonies, the con men, and the organized criminals of this world, regardless of race, color, or creed."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> The film is most critical in its portrayal of the [[Mafia]]. According to Bakshi, "I was incensed at all the hero worship of those guys in ''[[The Godfather]]''; [[Al Pacino|Pacino]] and [[James Caan|Caan]] did such a great job of making you like them. [...] One thing that stunned me about ''The Godfather'' movie: here's a mother who gives birth to children, and her husband essentially gets all her sons killed. In ''Coonskin'', she gets her revenge, but also gets shot. She turns into a butterfly and gets crushed.

Thomas, Gordone, and White also provide the voices of the film's main animated characters. In the film's ending credits, the actors were only credited for their live-action roles, and all voice actors who did not appear in the live-action sequences were left uncredited. Among the voices featured in the film was [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]], best known for appearing as Grandpa on ''[[The Munsters]]''.<ref name="Metro-2"/><ref name="Metro"/> According to Bakshi, the entire cast "[was] all a little nervous, except for Charles Gordone, who plays Preacher/Brother Fox. [...] He was ecstatic about the chance to do this. Whenever I had doubts, he'd reassure me, 'Rait on, motherfucker!' [...] Barry and Charles were behind it 1,000 percent."<ref name="Metro"/> Bakshi also worked with Gordone on the film ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330691/ |title=Charles Gordone filmography |accessdate=2007-06-10 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and worked with Thomas again on the film ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]''.<ref name="Best"/> ===Directing=== [[File:RalphBakshiJan09.jpg|thumb|left|Ralph Bakshi in January 2009]] The experience of living in both Brownsville and Foggy Bottom was a major influence on his work. While designing the look of ''Fritz the Cat'', ''Heavy Traffic'', and ''Coonskin'', Bakshi emphasized an intentionally crude quality in the animation. He is quoted as saying "What I was trying to do was relate to the person in the street. I was looking for a sort of [[Graffiti]] Art feel—the colors, the structure, a certain crudeness of backgrounds. I even used grainy films at times. The important thing to me was to relate to a certain type of person that I grew up with. To do what I call an art of the street, a 'Ghetto Art.' It's my form of expression."<ref name="James"/> Bakshi has also stated "The art of cartooning is vulgarity. The only reason for cartooning to exist is to be on the edge. If you only take apart what they allow you to take apart, you're Disney. Cartooning is a low-class, for-the-public art, just like graffiti art and [[hip hop music|rap music]]. Vulgar but believable, that's the line I kept walking."<ref name="Metro-2"/> ''Coonskin'' uses a variety of different styles of artwork, filmmaking and storytelling techniques. Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] wrote that ''Coonskin'' "remains one of [Bakshi's] most exciting films, both visually and conceptually."<ref name="Metro-2"/> The use of a live-action frame story is a satirical reference to [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Song of the South]]''.<ref name="Metro"/> These sequences were shot in [[Oklahoma]]. The [[El Reno state prison]] was one of the locations used during filming. A week after Bakshi and his crew left, the prison was burned during a riot.<ref name="Metro"/> The film also uses live-action photographs and footage as backdrops for animated sequences, a filmmaking technique Bakshi previously employed in ''Heavy Traffic''. The filming of live-action footage also helped contribute elements to the film's story. According to Bakshi, while shooting live-action background footage on [[Times Square]] at 4&nbsp;am, a group of prostitutes came out and waved towards the camera before being chased off by the police. "That happened by accident, but we put it in the film. I never could have written anything that real in the script."<ref name="Metro"/> ===Writing=== Darius James writes that ''Coonskin'' "reads like an Uncle Remus folktale rewritten by [[Chester Himes]] with all the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-based [[surrealism]] of Nigerian author [[Amos Tutuola]]."<ref name="James"/> The film directly references the original African folk tales that the Uncle Remus storybooks were based on in two scenes that are directly reminiscent of the stories ''The Briar Patch'' and ''The Tar Baby''.<ref name="James"/> Writer and former [[pimp]] [[Iceberg Slim]] is briefly referenced in the dialogue of Preacher Fox, and the [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston|Liston–Ali]] fights are referenced in the film's final act, in which Brother Bear, like [[Sonny Liston]], is sold out to the Mafia.<ref name="Metro-2"/> The film also features a pastiche of cartoonist [[George Herriman]] and columnist [[Don Marquis]]' "[[archy and mehitabel]]", in a monologue about a cockroach that leaves the woman who loves him. Bakshi has stated that Herriman, a light-skinned African American [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]], is his favorite cartoonist.<ref name="James"/><ref name="Metro"/> According to Bakshi, the scene "is based on personal experiences of black men I knew who couldn't afford to feed their families, so they left because they couldn't stand to see them suffer."<ref name="Metro"/> Of the writing process, Bakshi stated "The way I worked was that everyone recorded the script. But then I would change my opinion over the course of the year I made the film. I read every black culture book I could get a hand on. Then my opinion on these matters would change. I ran my own studio—I had no boss. I was the director and the writer. I would write and rewrite and record all year. I was always in a state of flux in my films; the process was as important as a finished project."<ref name="Metro"/> In another interview, Bakshi stated "In ''Coonskin'', I was able to stop an entire movie and integrate Miss America poems. I would do two or three movies within a movie. I would use subtext of ideas and go with it wherever I felt it should go. That, to me, is extremely exciting—improvisational almost poetry, in a sense.

The song's structure is rooted in the history of plantations, when slaves would "shout" lines from poems and stories great distances across fields in unison, creating a natural beat, and its fast guitar licks and rhymes feature what Bakshi described as "an early version of [[rapping|rap]]".<ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/> The song "Hit the Deck" from [[Ice-T]]'s 1989 album ''[[The Iceberg/Freedom Of Speech...

It was that kind of night. The audience was very frightened. They were being attacked verbally throughout the movie. People kept running up and down the aisles in pitch blackness."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> In a 1982 interview, Bakshi stated "I had finished the film on a Friday, I screened it in California for the museum on a Monday, and on Wednesday when I came to New York to screen it there were pickets there.

I never saw anything so set up in my life, but the press never picked up on that."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> Bakshi asked [[Al Sharpton]] why he didn't come in and see the movie. In response, Sharpton announced, "I don't got to see shit; I can smell shit!"<ref name="Metro"/> In a 2008 interview, Bakshi stated that "I called Sharpton a black middle-class fucking sell-out, and I'll say it to his face.

'Ah, let's watch the film.'"<ref name="Metro"/> "They were geared to dislike it" says Bakshi. "They were booing at the ''titles''! I guess it was an easy target. Or they were paid to do it. I don't know. It was very unusual. They were booing at something they hadn't even seen. This was interesting to me."<ref name="James"/> After the screening, Bakshi states that Sharpton charged up to the screen, but "people didn't want to follow Sharpton up the aisle. His own men! He was screaming to me on the podium and turning around to them, saying, 'Are you guys coming up?' But they didn't want to, because they loved the movie."<ref name="BlackBook"/> Gregg Kilday of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that "About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They walked up and down the aisles and were very belligerent. In my estimation they were determined not to like the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental to the image of blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> Animation historian [[Jerry Beck]] did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. "It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> According to Bakshi, "there were five people who were very angry at me and were very vocal. There were two hundred people sitting in their seats that applauded the film tremendously. It's always the five people in a room that want to scream, and those are the ones that are going to be heard. That's what really happened. I laughed at the controversy."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> According to Ruddy, he had been told that "there were about four hundred people there. I think ten or fifteen blacks took objection to some of the things, and they had somewhat of a scream-out with Ralph at the end [...] It was also for the board of the museum. They loved it. They thought it was a classic."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> Following the showing, the Paramount Building in New York City was picketed by CORE. [[Elaine Parker]], chairman of the Harlem chapter of CORE, had spoken out against the film in January 1975. She told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that the film "depicts us as slaves, hustlers and whores. It's a racist film to me, and very insulting. She then threatened, "if it is released, there's no telling what we might do." The Los Angeles chapter of CORE demanded that Paramount not release the film, claiming that it was "highly objectionable to the black community."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> The [[NAACP]] had written a letter describing the film as a difficult satire, but supported it.<ref name="James"/> Bakshi has stated, "The film was positive black in a huge way. It shows what white people think of blacks. I'm not a racist. I couldn't understand it and I still can't. If I were a racist for the [[Ku Klux Klan]], I could understand it. But how could I understand the booing?"<ref name="James"/> With Paramount's permission, Bakshi and Ruddy got contractually released, and the Bryanston Distributing Company was assigned the rights to the film.<ref name="Cohen-84"/><ref name="James"/> Two weeks after the film opened, the distributor went bankrupt.<ref name="Cohen-84"/><ref name="James"/> According to a May 1975 issue of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[Ben Gage]] was hired to rerecord Barry White's voice track, in order to remove "racist references and vulgarity."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> ''Coonskin'' was given limited distribution, advertised as a blaxploitation film. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote in his review of the film: <blockquote>''Coonskin'' is said by its director to be about blacks and for whites, and by its ads to be for blacks and against whites. Its title was originally intended to break through racial stereotypes by its bluntness, but now the ads say the hero and his pals are out "to get [[the Man]] to stop calling them coonskin." The movie's original distributor, Paramount, dropped it after pressure from black groups. Now it's being sold by Bryanston as an attack on the system. [...] ''Coonskin'' is provocative, original and deserves better than being sold as the very thing it's not.<ref name="Ebert">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750101/REVIEWS/501010309/1023 |title=Review of ''Coonskin'' |accessdate=2007-03-25 |last= |first= |authorlink=Roger Ebert |coauthors= |date=January 1, 1975 |year= |month= |work= |author=Ebert, Roger |location=Chicago|work=Sun-Times |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref></blockquote> According to Bakshi, when [[Martin Scorsese]] was filming second-unit material for ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' near [[Times Square]], a [[smoke bomb]] was thrown into a theater showing ''Coonskin'', and Scorsese sent Bakshi footage of audience members running out of the theater. "I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but it's okay now."<ref name="Metro"/> In a 1982 article published in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Carol Cooper wrote "''Coonskin'' was driven out of theaters by a misguided minority, most of whom had never seen the film. CORE's pickets at Paramount's [[Gulf and Western]] headquarters and, later, a few smoke bombs lobbed into packed Broadway theaters were enough; theater owners were intimidated, and the auxiliary distributor, Bryanston, couldn't book the film. Bye-Bye ''Coonskin''."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> ==Critical response== Initial reviews of the film were negative. ''[[Playboy]]'' said of the film, "Bakshi seems to throw in a little of everything and he can't quite pull it together."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> A review published in ''The Village Voice'' called the film "the product of a crippled hand and a paralyzed mind."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> Arthur Cooper wrote in ''[[Newsweek]]'', "[Bakshi] doesn't have much affection for man or woman kind—black or white."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> Eventually, positive reviews appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', the ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'' (an African American newspaper), and elsewhere, but the film died at the box office.<ref name="Cohen-84"/> Richard Eder of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "[''Coonskin''] could be his masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort to use an uncommon form—cartoons and live action combined—to convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [does it] exploit violence."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> ''Variety'' called the film a "brutal satire from the streets. Not for all tastes [...] not avant-garde. [...] The target audience is youth who read comics in the undergrounds."<ref name="Cohen-84"/> A reviewer for ''The Los Angeles Herald Examiner'' wrote "Certainly, it will outrage some and indeed it's not Disney.
